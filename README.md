# GuidanceTutorial-Database

guidancetutorialdb is designed for [GuidanceTutorial](https://mivanrais.github.io/GuidanceTutorial/) website.

Before I jump right into create the database, I have created conceptual ERDs in [draw.io](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vfj7gMhZZVeaAc4VI-5JWotGg2pjtgqS/view?usp=sharing) 

In this repository, it contains two files: 

1. GuidanceTutorial_Db.sql contains queries that I have created.
2. guidancetutorialdb.sql contains queries from export feature in phpMyAdmin so you can import this file into your phpMyAdmin.
